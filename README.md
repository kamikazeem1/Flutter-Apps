I don't really know how to use git yet but the .dart files are basically all we'll need (once you have your environment set up).

The set up can be confusing but what you'll need is Android Studio for the emulator, the Flutter Framework, Git, and I think that's it. There's a lot of tutorials online on dart and the setup but if you need help just let me know. Once you have have everything set up, just copy and paste the .dart files into the lib directory and everything should work fine. So far, all I've made is a simple layout of a sample app, and you can mess around with it.
